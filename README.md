# Landing page

So this is my attempt to build a webpage again. Itâ€™s been a while:)
So I have multiple goals with this project. First off I needed a landing page for a small project I have and be able to have some sort of simple stats for views. The second was to try out lighthouse in Chrome. 

I am pleased to say that I learn alot about stuff like new image formats, bootstrap, and other optimasation stuff. And lighthouse is giving me abot 96 to 99% 

## Getting Started

So this is realy simple, just clone it and change the password in index.php. I've not structured that realy good so it is in the first if() in the file.

### Installing

This is jusing PHP, so you need a PHP server to make it run.the main html is in the raw.txt file. But there is a edit.html I use for working. When Im done, just copy the html over to the raw.txt file, and publis it. I see the ironi of this as I am writing it. Why dont I just read the edit.html, well ... next time.

## License

Ah, I dont care. You can use this as you want. Maby not use my personal image, that's just creepy.
